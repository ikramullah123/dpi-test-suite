<h1>libfixbuf - IPFIX Protocol Library </h1><h3 class="version">1.3.0 </h3><h2><a class="anchor" id="Introduction">
Introduction</a></h2>
<p>libfixbuf is a compliant implementation of the IPFIX Protocol, as defined in the "Specification of the IPFIX Protocol for the Export of IP
 Flow Information" (RFC 5101). It supports the information model defined in "Information Model for IP Flow Information Export" (RFC 5102), extended as proposed by "Bidirectional Flow Export using
 IPFIX" (RFC 5103) to support information elements for representing biflows.</p>
<p>libfixbuf supports UDP, TCP, SCTP, TLS over TCP, and Spread as transport protocols. Support for DTLS over UDP and DTLS over SCTP is forthcoming. It also supports operation as an IPFIX File Writer or IPFIX File Reader as defined in "An IPFIX-Based File Format" (draft-trammell-ipfix-file, current revision -05).</p>
<p>As of version 1.0, libfixbuf supports structured data elements as described in "Export of Structured Data in IPFIX" (RFC 6313). This adds the ability to export basicLists, subTemplateLists, and subTemplateMultiLists.</p>
<p>libfixbuf's public API is defined in <a class="el" href="public_8h.html" title="fixbuf IPFIX protocol library public interface.">public.h</a>; see the documentation of that file for general documentation on getting started with libfixbuf, as well as detailed documentation on the public API calls and data types.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="Downloading">
Downloading</a></h2>
<p>libfixbuf is distributed from <a href="http://tools.netsa.cert.org/fixbuf">http://tools.netsa.cert.org/fixbuf</a></p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="Building">
Building</a></h2>
<p>libfixbuf uses a reasonably standard autotools-based build system. The customary build procedure (<code>./configure &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make install</code>) should work in most environments.</p>
<p>libfixbuf requires glib-2.0 version 2.6.4 or later. If built against version 2.10 or later, it will automatically use the glib slab allocator for increased memory allocation performance. glib is available on most modern Linux distributions and BSD ports collections, or in source form from <a href="http://www.gtk.org">http://www.gtk.org</a>.</p>
<p>libfixbuf automatically uses the getaddrinfo(3) facility and the accompanying dual IPv4/IPv6 stack support if present. getaddrinfo(3) must be present to export or collect flows over IPv6.</p>
<p>libfixbuf does not build with SCTP support by default. The --with-sctp option must be given to the libfixbuf ./configure script to include SCTP support. Also note that SCTP requires kernel support, and applications built against libfixbuf with libsctp may fail at runtime if that kernel support is not present.</p>
<p>libfixbuf does not build with TLS support by default. The --with-openssl option must be given to the libfixbuf ./configure script to include TLS support.</p>
<p>Spread support requires <a href="http://www.spread.org">Spread</a> 4.1 or later. libfixbuf does not build with Spread support by default. The --with-spread option must be given to libfixbuf ./configure script to include Spread support.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="Known">
Issues</a></h2>
<p>The following are known issues with libfixbuf as of version 1.0.0:</p>
<ul>
<li>
There is no support for DTLS over UDP or DTLS over SCTP transport. </li>
<li>
There is no support for application-selectable SCTP stream assignment or SCTP partial reliability. Templates are sent reliably on stream 0, and data sets are sent reliably on stream 1.  </li>
<li>
There is no automatic support for periodic template retransmission or periodic template expiration as required when transporting IPFIX over UDP. Applications using libfixbuf to transport IPFIX messages over UDP must maintain these timeouts and manually manage the session. However, inactive UDP collector sessions are timed out after 30 minutes, at which time the session is freed and all templates associated with the session are removed.  </li>
</ul>
